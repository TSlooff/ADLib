# AD Lib
General scripts for anomaly detection. Included in this git repository is both the Dockerfile used to create the image, and the Docker-Compose file which uses the image to run the model selection and anomaly detection scripts. 

## Model Selection
To run the model selection you can use the following command:
`docker-compose run anomaly_detection python -m adlib.model_selection --swarming 100 -n 2 --global_time 2`
In this example the swarming optimization is used with 100 particles, 2 processors will be used, and global time indicates the amount of minutes to look for the best model before saving the best found thus far. For all options use the -h or --help flag. 
- The script will look at the first data file in the /app/data folder in the docker, which has a volume to ./data by default. You can change this in the docker-compose file if you want the volume to point somewhere else. 
- The script will output the best model it found to the /app/model folder in the docker, which has a volume to ./model. You can change this as well in the docker-compose file.

## Anomaly Detection
To run the anomaly detection you can use the following command:
`docker-compose run anomaly_detection python -m adlib.detection`
- The script will use the first model it finds in /app/model, which has the volume set to ./model/, to perform the detection. It is assumed the data looks like the data used for model selection.
- This model will be used to perform detection on all data files in /app/data, which has the volume set to ./data/, and output a dictionary named `anomalies.json` where the keys are the names of the datafiles, and the values will be the list of indexes where anomalies were found.


## Metadata
Depending on the input data and desired functionality, some additional metadata may be necessary. For local testing I have used json files for this, but in the future we can use the LEXIS API where users can define the additional metadata needed. This metadata is only needed once during the model selection stage, as the metadata will subsequently be saved in the model and automatically retrieved for the detection. For numpy arrays saved using numpy.save, and generally csv or excel files, no metadata should be required unless specific functionality is needed.

Please find below a description of the expected metadata:

For valid strings see numpy.sctypeDict                 NOTE: if you use numpy.tofile(),   all shape information is also lost so this should also be included in the   datatype description if it is important. I would recommend to use   numpy.save() instead, as this works much better.          |                                                     |
